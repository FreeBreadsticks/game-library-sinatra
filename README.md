# Game Tracker

## Usage
Welcome to Game Tracker! Users can manage their personal library of games with ease by using this app! When adding a game you are to write your own personal notes about it as well as give it a rating. In the future I hope to give users the ability to track wether or not you have completed the games in your library!

## Installation
Simply clone this repository,

Then execute

```ruby
  bundle install
```
Then run

    $ rake db:migrate

From there, run

    $ shotgun

If everything is installed correctly you should see an output of a html link in the console. Copy that link and paste into your browser window. From there you are free to play around and make your own list!
